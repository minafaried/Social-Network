Phase 3: Final SDS Document + Draft implementation
•	In this phase you are required to enhance you SDS document by considering TA comments, add any missing class, remove any unnecessary  classes, consider applying SOLID principles and using design patterns
•	Each class in your design should be responsible for only one single responsibility
•	Enhance the sequence diagrams, add any missing ones and enhance the quality of them by considering TA comments
•	So, You are required to deliver an updated SDS document with the enhanced and finalized class diagram and sequence diagrams
•	Convert the class diagram to a java classes, just dummy/empty java classes to show that you have a good understanding for your class diagram design and the relation of your classes. If you are using ArgoUML you convert your design automatically to java classes
•	You are required to implement only the following functionalities
1.	User should be able to register into the system to be able to use its functionalities. Registration process needs user’s info like name, password, email, gender, country, date of birth. After a successful registration, a new account will be registered for the user.

Logged user can upgrade the registration subscription by paying 99$ for a year subscription. Paying process should be allowed via credit card or PayPal.
•	You should write a unit test-cases for both requirement 1 (Sign up requirement), requirement 3 (send friend request) and requirement 4 (accept friend request).
•	You should use Git for team collaboration. Git history must show that the team is using it frequently and all members use it.
